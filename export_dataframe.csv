Jon G.,"Ok modern warfare 2 has the best multiplayer of any games. first it runs at 50fps (50 frames per second)(real life speed). no other first person shooter has done that yet!! and it never glitches.awesome guns perks and everything. how can you say this multiplayer is boring or not fun. is proably because you suuck balls at this game and stop whinning and giving it bad reviews because of your lack of skill and knowledge in video games. just cause you suck doesn't mean you can rate the game bad. and for all 40 of you who gave it 1 star. your retardid. this game is the bestselling game of all time AND THATS FACT. obviously its not 1 star material. it also got a 10/10 by most critics im pretty sure its not a 1 star game. i've played every game on the xbox 360. this is arguably the best one. oh and for the kid who called activision about his broken copy, sorry buddy discs just don't stop working for no reason. you obviously scratched and ruined your copy. oh and by the way ""Activision"" did not make this game, they published it. so obviously their not going to give your a new copy. infinity ward made it so no wonder activision doesn't care about your broken game. YOU BROKE IT!!!",5,1

RealSlimShady22,"Game came brand new, still sealed in plastic cover. Came included with a double sided poster as seen in photo. Seller didn't tell me about the poster do was a pleasant surprise. Yes it can be played on xbox one and you can still play online with other people as of February 2019. No scratches on disk. Works fine. Would buy again. Recommend buying mw3 along with this. Very satisfying",5,1

Chuck Wells,"Received the product within a couple of days after purchase (shipping was not an issue). I open the case and inspected the used/refurbished disk and it seemed like normal ware and tear. I put it in my xbox 360, it loaded to the main screen and then could not read past it. A window pulled up indicated the disk could not be read. I tried whipping it off multiple times and also installing the content to my xbox, but nothing would work. I have returned the item and will try purchasing it again. I may have just received a faulty item. I will update my review if the next one works. Though really, what can you expect for less than $10???",1,0
CoyKoiCourtney,"I enjoy a wide variety of games.
I am not at all a fan of the most recent CoD games and in fact I think this is the only one I've enjoyed.
I've always been a Battlefield woman, but after being nagged by every other man I know to play CoD, this was it.
Then again, if you've played one FPS, you've played them all really.",5,1
jacob joeckel,Wanted to replay it and was surprised by how cheap it was. It also arrived a day earlier than expected,5,1
Todd Groves,"What is most unfortunate about Modern Warfare 2, is that it no longer receives the level of support and updating it deserves. I had the most fun I've ever had playing MW2. If the developers supported MW2 with dedicated servers and regular updates, I would be all over this game. The one other COD that comes to mind is World At War. A masterpiece by Treyarch.",5,1

Patty K,"I LOVE first-person shooters. However I have always been much more of a “Halo guy” than a “CoD guy.” The online multiplayer for Halo has always been more fun for me because I feel skill wins out more often than not in games like Halo than in CoD. When you have a shield and a lesser talented player gets the drop on you you can still recover. In games like CoD where there is no shield I feel like it’s much easier for a player with lesser skill to “camp” and that strategy to be more effective. All that being said, where CoD has always had the edge is in the Solo Campaigns; espically in World War or Black Ops CoD games. However I have never found the Modern Warfare games to be very much fun, so this game slipped through the cracks despite the fact I heard very good things regarding its gameplay. Therefore when it recently became Backwards Compatiable on my Xbox One I decided to finally give it a try.

The first thing that jumped out to me was the fact that, despite being almost 10 years old, the game holds up as far as the graphics are concerned. Other than a few frame rate issues (which may have been my monitor) you could have told me it came out last year and I couldn’t have argued with you. In comparison, I’m currently playing through Mass Effect (released two years prior to CoD MW2) and, even though ME doesn’t look bad at all, there is a noticeable difference between the two games. I know a lot of progress can be made in two years, but it just goes to show you how much effort went into making this game look beautiful. That being said, the story left much to be desired (see my CT above). It wasn’t just the fact that you can play the entire story in an afternoon, but also the story itself is pretty ridiculous. You really have to shut your brain off to really enjoy it fully. Don’t get me wrong, the story had some really fun moments, but it felt like the developers started to work on the story by building a few memorable moments. Then they stitched the rest of the story around those moments. It made the story feel like “empty calories.”

In conclusion, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 definately holds up graphically, but the story, despite having several really fun/memorable moments, leaves much to be desired.",4,1

Hisham,"Amazing game. Although the multiplayer is pretty difficult for me, (I'm a noob) I enjoyed it very much. Spec Ops is a great co-operative mode to play with friends and can get intensely joyful. The campaign is the best part about this work of art. It offers relatable characters, a surprising plot, fun and unrepetitive missions and an addictive bonus level. The only parts I disliked about this game was the Rio missions and some of the crappy maps. Other than that, this is a 95% masterpiece.",5,1

Step,"The pros and cons of this game are divided, but I would like to write it while comparing it with the previous CoD4.

First, campaign mode. I don't understand English, so I don't know the story at all.
I played with the intention of enjoying the atmosphere to the last. I was shocked by the cinematic and overwhelming sense of realism of the previous film, but I
think the production is even more amazing in this film. However, the realism of the previous film has faded, the battlefield has become lively, and it has become more cinematic.
It was a shame that even if you collected the laptops that were in the previous game, they were only involved in unlocking achievements, and that the enemy AI seemed a bit unnatural.

Next, Special Ops, a new element. This is a mission that is played by 1 or 2 people. The number of missions is 23.
When two people cooperate, each can choose a different level of difficulty, so I think both experienced people and beginners can enjoy playing.
I completed the campaign mode at the highest difficulty level, but I found this one at the highest difficulty level to be more difficult.
After all, it would be more fun to play with friends, and I think it would be easier to capture.

And online matches. Honestly, it's very difficult to evaluate at the moment.
Since the previous game, CoD4, had a godly balance, there were a lot of expectations, but I have to say that balance is out of balance.

First, the organization of the map. The map has become much wider, and the difference in elevation has increased. As a result, as other people have reviewed, the camp is strong.
Furthermore, the balance of weapons has also changed drastically, and coupled with the map configuration, assault rifles stand out in particular.
The reason most people use an assault rifle as their primary weapon is because they are so versatile and preferential that there is no need to choose another weapon.
You can easily beat a submachine gun even at close range, and there is virtually no distance where a submachine gun is strong.

In addition, since weapons such as machine pistols and shotguns can be carried as secondary weapons, there is almost no advantage of using a submachine gun as the main weapon, and the
main one emphasizes long distances It is now possible to use it properly with weapons. The
results are more conducive to camping, such as camping using strong weapons at long distances and intercepting enemies with a shotgun when they approach. In particular, the performance of shotguns has improved considerably, submachine guns have an unnecessary firing range, and since they
are easy and effective to use with main weapons, there are so many users.

Also, as far as I can think of, there are two other factors that make camping stronger.
One is feeling that your physical strength is low. I tried CoD4 and compared them, but obviously, it can be hit as soon as it's hit.
Even though the number of high-power weapons has increased, it doesn't seem like that's all. I think it's probably because the bullet hits easily as the hit detection gets bigger.
As you can see when using an assault rifle in particular, there are times when the enemy is hit by a bullet even if the aim is not right.
The other is the bounce when hit. When hit, the viewpoint jumps up greatly, and the aim is blocked.
When it comes to shooting each other, if you can get the first move, you can interfere with your opponent's aim and attack unilaterally. There are no more shootouts like CoD4.
I think that's why there are so many camps where it's easy to get ahead

There is a lag associated with online matches, but on the other hand, I feel that it has decreased compared to the previous game, but I feel that it has become more troublesome.
As mentioned above, this game was done right away, making it difficult to shoot each other. There are many things you can't do if you get ahead due to lag.
There are ways to cover this with fighting, but there are also phenomena that don't work as a game.

It was done when I was about to reach a corner, so when I looked at the kill camera wondering where it was shot from, I saw
that it was hit by an enemy at the end of the corner that hadn't even turned yet Turns out. There was a figure of me running out of the corner and jumping out.
Other than that, even if it was supposed to be done from the front, there were times when there were no enemies on the screen, stabbed with a knife by an enemy who turned their back here, or
if they were running against an empty wall, suddenly An enemy slowly emerges like a ghost, and even an inexplicable thing happens, such as being killed by that enemy.
None of these are events that did not occur in the previous game.

Apparently there are different types of lag, and there are many that come out with a delay in hit detection, but in some cases the enemy's physical strength has improved markedly, and
no matter how much you shoot, hit detection at all There are times when it doesn't come out. There's no way to beat it even if you shoot it from directly behind.
If you don't prepare for this kind of thing to happen, you'll feel uncomfortable.

So far, there have been bad reviews about this game, but what I really want to complain about is some of the players.

The game currently has bugs that still remain even when a fix patch comes in. Too many players make use of them.
I want people to know more about the fact that using that bug can greatly benefit and make other players uncomfortable.

Also, even if it's not a bug, there are things that take away the original enjoyment of this game by making specific combinations.
Combinations where you can shoot an infinite number of grenade launchers are prime examples of this. It's not a foul play, it's easy to win.
It's very annoying for serious players, and there are too many people who use it easily even though each person should put their own weight on it.

I don't know if I want to win or if I want to harass them, but I want them to value being a little more attentive to their surroundings.
With this, new entrants and people who want to have fun in a fair and dignified manner will move away.

You can see that the developers are also trying to keep players entertained. There are also things that have collapsed as a result.
However, you wouldn't have thought that the value of this game would be tainted by some players who take advantage of minor shortcomings and run complacent.
I strongly hope that you will come into contact with the possibilities of “Modern Warfare 2.”

Excuse me for the long and random sentences.",4,1
ATIKAS,"About
a week after the online match arrived, I was frustrated by the amount of “waiting” as other reviews say.
However, if you think about it carefully, isn't it a wrong act to proceed carefully on an unfamiliar MAP?
Anyone wouldn't want to mass produce Death numbers.
If you think so, you'll be a little more lenient about “waiting”...?
Also, it's been about 3 weeks since it went on sale.
“Waiting” has decreased a lot since the beginning.
I think the ratio is about the same as COD4.
I only feel that the “waiting” I'm meeting now is for Asians, including Japanese people, or people who aren't used to low-level MAPs.

I can say it's more interesting than COD4.
◆ Everyone watched the replay of Last Kill.
In the replay of Kaisin's play, there is a growling voice regardless of whether they are enemies or allies.
It would feel pretty good if that were me!
◆ Unlock TITLE/EMBREM by completing the challenge CALLSIGN (TITLE/EMBREM) displayed when you
defeat it, when you are defeated, or when you perform a special action Customize it to your own way!
◆ Tons of Kill Streak bonuses to
customize your own playstyle and balance with your friends!
◆Countermeasure against it The Kill Streak bonus, which
looks powerful, also has a way to counter it, and if you prepare well, there are no musou with bonuses.
◆The power of the flag has been reduced.
The snowball fight has disappeared.

What I like the most is that supportive actions are also appreciated.
Hold a shield to prevent enemy bullets, and if an ally fights back from behind, even if you prevent it, it won't affect your team score, but you'll get points, and if you drop an enemy UAV or aircraft weapon, you'll get a solid CALLSIGN It's displayed and so on.

It's evolved from COD4, and I think it's getting more interesting.

However, if you are starting with the Japanese version, it may take some time to get used to it due to the disparity of weapons depending on the level...",4,1
User 1000,"Bought it for XBOX 360 -

100% Authentic.",5,1
shusuke,"This is the North American edition.
This is a comparison impression with COD4. I'm currently playing on CRT TVs, and I've never felt that I'm at a disadvantage in my battle record.

I had heard that the map had become larger overall, but personally I didn't feel that much of a difference. I was imagining something so large, so maybe I thought so. However, there are certainly quite a few differences in elevation. Overall, COD4 is simple, and there's an image that it's messy here. So until I got used to it, I didn't know where the enemy was aiming and I was worried.

Regarding the indication that there are more campers compared to COD4.
Campers just ambush enemies in certain places, but I felt that there were certainly a lot of them compared to COD4.
However, I feel that this is mostly due to the “game winning kill,” a function introduced in this game where you can see the kill camera of players who have reached the score limit in deathmatch etc., and decide the game Maybe it is.
Depending on the rules of the game, it is played at the end of every match, so I think that impression becomes stronger. It slowly replays the few seconds just before the kill, so it may seem as if you were camping there even though you just came a few seconds ago.

Since I had looked at the reviews beforehand, I had the image that it was difficult to walk around the map because it was full of campers and it was difficult to find enemies, but I can walk there normally.
There are many places to hide, so I think there are some situations where you have to camp rather than walk around poorly.
I'm the type who can't wait, so I run around quite boldly, but I've never felt that campers were a threat.
However, I think it will be difficult at first for those who are unfamiliar with FPS.

Another thing you'll notice right away is a decrease in physical strength.
It was pointed out in other reviews, but I was wondering if it was because of my mind. However, they are actually killed in battle soon after. I noticed this right away. What was done with “Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa” in COD4 is the feeling of being played with “Papa Papa Papa Papa” in this game. Personally, I try to think that being real is fine, but it still bothers me from time to time.
After that, my score has increased by one digit. So when I look at match bonuses, etc., I think they worked really hard.

There are also elements that have become interesting.
Killstreaks have increased, and it's also good to be able to choose your own.
It might be different for each person though. I didn't like it because I felt that it was too complicated at first.
I also had the view that the balance was unbalanced, such as combining a grenade launcher with an ammo refill park, but if you raise your arm, you won't feel threatened by anything, so recently I'm starting to find it very interesting.

I think the ratings are divided.
The impression is different from COD4. The opinion that the game balance was broken is also understandable.

I didn't expect to see the reviews either, so I tried to summarize them with positive reviews before people thinking about buying didn't like buying them.

It's a matter of feeling, and I think every review will be helpful.",4,1
ルドルフ748,"I bought the North American version about 2 weeks before the release of the
Japanese version, and later I also bought the Japanese version.

First, I will state the noticeable advantages and disadvantages of each as an individual opinion
< Advantages >
North American version: There are no lies that liven up the atmosphere, such as mistranslations, and it makes you feel like you've entered the world of movies.

Japanese version: Even with mistranslations, the story is easier to understand than the overseas version. The situation is easy to understand (both campaigns and online) because they say supplementary lines that don't include subtitles during the game in Japanese for the time being.
It's easy even for beginners to get started.

＜Disadvantages＞
North American Edition: It's hard to understand the situation. I don't know what you're saying. Therefore, the story often becomes “why did that happen”... You don't know until you imagine an explanation of the weapon on or look it up on the site.
The above has nothing to do with fluent English speakers.

Japan version: Because I made it all Japanese translations (dubbed and subtitles for some reason) the Japanese translation of a Western movie looks like Friday Road Show → it's a mess of realism
and there are so many mistranslations . That's too much. “No Russian.” at the airport = “Kill me. I burst out laughing when I heard “I'm Russian.” Correctly,
not only in the “Don't Speak Russian” story, but also on the weapon settings screen that's on, there's a sense of discomfort in some places... It's disgusting because I'm going out of my way to put the kanji for okay in katakana notation,,, the
rank of the soldier in the story has been changed without permission. I have

some personal feelings (no hindrance), but since it's a personal opinion...
However, as a result, I thought the Japanese version would be easier to do.
I thought even when it was on.
For example, even if you hear “point A
will be taken” in Japanese, it's easy to respond quickly, but when it's said in English, I often listened to it.
However, after all, the atmosphere was a Friday road show. I'll get used to it in a few days.

＜Impressions of Multiplay＞
As for the game itself, the settings are a bit more detailed and complicated than CoD4, so I wonder if likes and dislikes can be divided...
It's easier to die compared to 4 because likes and dislikes can also be divided. very much.
There are also challenging elements such as split screens, ranks, weapon settings, etc.
Personally, I was very satisfied.

＜Campaign Impressions＞
CoD Supreme Easiest Win...?
I cleared veterans due to performance issues, but I often didn't get shot “more than I expected.” Was it
simply set up so that everyone would receive it (it must not be easy, but in the sense of “better than expected”)?

I've written long sentences above, but what bothers me in the end is the Japanese version that is easy to understand even if you put up with
mistranslation and full dubbing
・The North American version with an emphasis on atmosphere
Right. I highly

recommend this software for each person anyway. If you're an FPS person, you should definitely buy one. On population over 3 million people (XBOX360)",5,1

danke,"I just cleared Offline with normal difficulty.

It was quite criticized that offline was short, both domestically and internationally, so I didn't expect much off play.
When I actually tried it, I certainly felt that each mission was short and unsatisfactory.
But the production and things in the map have been created, and it's true that it's a monumental FPS COD!! The quality is high!! I groaned while looking at the screen lol I would
personally be happy if they released this quality in 2 years.

The music is here too! At that time, it really livens up the story without being too flashy, and it attracts players.

Also, I thought after playing Airport Assault Missions, which are still regulated in the Japanese version, or unannounced and unclear, but I feel that they have an important meaning in the story There may not be any deletions. If you shoot civilians like the German version, the game might be over. Even in the North American version, during the first NEW GAME, there are missions that may offend you, so you can decide whether to skip them or not.

When damaged, the screen becomes quite difficult to see due to blood splashes, too much blood skips, is it subject to regulation? It's about a rumor, but it's been whispered.
Personally, I feel like if you regulate this to suppress blood splashes, you'll have a slight advantage over people who aren't regulated when playing online, so I wonder why.

I'll try playing online tomorrow, where the pros and cons are divided!",4,1
たろう,"A
number of complaints about the previous CoD4 sequel, which sold 14 million copies worldwide, have been fixed, but the fun has also been lost.

First, hit detection was transferred to the client side, making it easier to defeat enemies. However, in other words, it became easier to be defeated, so the bargaining at the time of the encounter was lost. The shootout ends unexpectedly.
Next, the map became larger and more complicated, but the map was not made as much as the previous game, and since there are many open places and straight lines, it has become a sniper heaven. The aforementioned winning judgment and the abolition of the Juggernaut, which was unpopular in the previous game, are also spurring.
Sniper is a powerful unit that can kill an enemy from a long distance, so it should be balanced by limiting the open space and neutralizing it due to smoke, etc., but in this game, that balance is remarkable It's been badly damaged.
Also, the fun of handling a shotgun is fighting until you get close to an enemy, but in this game, the range has been extended, and the fun of fighting has diminished due to the performance of a certain shotgun.
Other than that, there are various things such as HBS, flags, wall removal, etc., but I doubt whether this work did not have enough adjustment period to make it in time for release, or if it was made without understanding the fun of the previous work.

I wrote only complaints about ON, but it's not bad for a game at all.
However, it is better to stop expecting it as a sequel to CoD4.",4,1
Tanvir saini,Received in good quality..good game,4,1
東京少年,"I wrote a review before, but I decided to rewrite it. I'll write about ON. It's just personal, but my LV goes up quickly. Along with that, park (park challenge) weapons, camouflage, and equipment (far more than 4!!!!) For example, playing with M4 (initial weapon) feels like 20 lv or more (2 or 3 hours) in 2 days. However, I wonder if it's a troubled park, and if you aim for this park challenge, there are quite a few kills (does it depend on it?) Decrease. So of course, if you're not good at LV, it feels like it takes close to double.
Incidentally, M4's Marksman (equipment) dot (hollow sight) silencer (sensor) grenade (master key).. The same goes for Park Challenge, such as ACOG, Thermal, and Feeling (Relevance) the weapon and equipment to take this weapon... If you don't kill with a fixed park, it won't count towards your challenge kills.
As usual, everyone (almost none before pounding like 4) is a camper. If you can earn points with that, don't you dare to make 4 and MW2 different types of games (on)?? 4 and MW2 are so different that it seems so (MW2 stealth game??) There are always maps that are medium to large, high and low, and small (don't let me do that) (camper) if everyone is in a place suitable for campers, that's better (on the scene!!) but in Afghanistan?? I personally don't understand. Then play stealth games. Isn't that a team deathmatch? If it's a role, I can understand it at all.. (No players hit), so I'm not happy with consecutive kills with that. I'll choose the one with 7 consecutive kills on the bloody screen. I've been playing with it for 2 years if it's COD... I want something to change when the Japanese version comes out (expectations!!!!!) 1 week. Camper hunting isn't bad either. The values are different, so on is the relationship of 4, none of which is just right (for people from now on) I like both 4 and MW2. So let's keep going for 4 too! Good graphics!! The gunfire is real. The sound difference between M4 (5.56 mm) SCAR (7.62 mm) and Assault is quite realistic! I can tell the difference just by listening to Barrett and EBR like Sniper. (By the way, the MW2 can also have a sniper with a silencer) It's pretty cool! BARRETT is probably the sound of the example. The Marksman Challenge (put on the silencer) hurts.",4,1
SIX,"When MW1 and MW2 came out and it was depopulated, what was
this camper, fixed point shooting.
It's as large as a BF, and there are too many places to hide in, and it's hard to do clearing
.
It's easier to defeat than the previous game, and it's easier to be defeated, because
it seems like you're in a minus hardcore mode, and you die unexpectedly. Therefore, when they move, they are shot by enemies who are camping and die soon after they hide.
Camping is an advantageous map, it's boring to always aim at the same place until each other moves out of control, or because of balance, and the camp ends with time running out without moving each other That there are a lot of games.
There is a feeling that the killstreak was overdone. Even in the previous game, helicopters and air strikes alone were quite a threat, but it
has fallen into a game where the goal is to just hang up and trigger a killstreak.
Wide and complex maps, rich killstreaks, and a large number of weapons.
Even though each one was delicious, it became a subtle taste when I filled in all the user's requests. I get such an impression.",3,0
a2694,"Campaigns and online matches are all fun.
It's really interesting to team up with Fure and do it together.

Also, special ops were newly added, and coop was made on top of that, and this was also addictive.
However, the setting that this can only be done with friends seemed pretty disappointing.

The playtime elements were also well made and I enjoyed it for a long time.
It makes me happy when weapons are unlocked little by little.
However, weapons that have been unlocked are never strong; rather, weapons that can be used in the early stages are more stable.
I think this is an easy setting for beginners to stick with.

But for some reason I liked the previous CD4 better, and now I'm completely back on CD4.

Is it because the map has become too wide?... It might be.",5,1
SU-拝者,"The Japanese dubbed version has a very bad reputation, so I bought this one. What are they saying? What kind of things are displayed on the screen? Most likely, I don't have much time to read subtitles while playing, so I can clear them even if I don't understand them at all. The next game doesn't need to be dubbed, so I'd like to try playing a game with Japanese subtitles.",4,1
anindya,"good product,nicely packaged,recommended.",5,1
伊藤誠,"Like everyone else, I was eagerly looking forward to the release of the Japanese version.
It was a week before it was released, completely dubbed in Japanese, with no switching function, a
mistranslation far surpassing the previous work, and the appointment of a daikon voice actor.
I can't say anything at all because I'm stunned by the water in my sleep.
I can't hold back my anger at what happened this past month that I've been waiting for.
If I had known this from the beginning of the announcement, I would have bought the North American version right away...

Square Enix should immediately give a clear explanation of the situation
and listen seriously to the live voices of users. If you can't do that,
either withdraw from localization altogether or go bankrupt. seriously.",5,1

父,"I feel like it was interesting.
Is it said that the making was polite.

There were too many enemies in the campaign, didn't they?

I wonder if online was too grelan kitchen too aside and it was tough for amateurs.

But I'm glad that the audio is more powerful than the Japanese version, and I didn't have to worry if there was a translation site.

Overall, it's 2.",2,0
ｴﾙ,"There are a lot of campers and everyone seems to need to go, but are there that many? I'm an Assault Soldier, and I live inside a building and get killed through a wall, but I don't think it's the same as the previous game.
If you are there, this is also great when you act cautiously and take a back seat. It's now easier to kill and easier to kill. Kill 15 or more will go lightly. There are a lot of people who get killed by that amount, but well, I go to the battlefield while thinking and using my head. I wonder if MW2, which took over the data that was made in the previous game, can be done ~.",5,1

kei,"After all, if it's not an English voice, you won't be able to convey this coolness. the voice of a strange bastard isn't exciting. After all, if this isn't a carnivorous wild father voice, the character's coolness will die. Incidentally, Rogue Warrior was also quite excited by Mickey Rourke's loud voice. As for the content of the game, this one is far superior, so needless to say, it's burning-out.",5,1
Vlidge,It surpasses the previous game in every way!! I'm surprised that this game has a low rating!!,5,1
yuu,"Compared to the previous game, there is no physical strength like hardcore, and you die just by hitting it a bit. I think it's good that the number of weapons, parks, air strike support, etc. has increased a lot, and the factors involved have increased considerably. However, there are many hiding places and buildings in this work, and there are many camps. I felt that people who are camping are overwhelmingly advantageous in this work... There are good points, but there are many bad points, so I can't recommend it very much.",2,0
むか,"COD4 is more fun online.
Or rather online is the most boring game I've ever played.

There are many knife-tied play because you can use a park where the knife hits a wider range, a park that makes your foot faster, and a park that can run forever at the same time.frustrating

Killstreak is too gorgeous, and the end of the game is only an attack from the air.

It is a dung game.",1,0
